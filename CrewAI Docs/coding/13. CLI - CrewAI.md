Learn how to use the CrewAI CLI to interact with CrewAI.

# [CrewAI CLI Documentation​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#crewai-cli-documentation)

The CrewAI CLI provides a set of commands to interact with CrewAI, allowing you to create, train, run, and manage crews & flows.

## [Installation​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#installation)

To use the CrewAI CLI, make sure you have CrewAI installed:

```shell
pip install crewai
```

## [Basic Usage​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#basic-usage)

The basic structure of a CrewAI CLI command is:

```shell
crewai [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]
```

## [Available Commands​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#available-commands)

### [Create a new crew or flow.​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#1-create)

1\. Create

```shell
crewai create [OPTIONS] TYPE NAME
```

- `TYPE`: Choose between “crew” or “flow”
- `NAME`: Name of the crew or flow

Example:

```shell
crewai create crew my_new_crew
crewai create flow my_new_flow
```

### [Show the installed version of CrewAI.​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#2-version)

2\. Version

```shell
crewai version [OPTIONS]
```

- `--tools`: (Optional) Show the installed version of CrewAI tools

Example:

```shell
crewai version
crewai version --tools
```

### [Train the crew for a specified number of iterations.​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#3-train)

3\. Train

```shell
crewai train [OPTIONS]
```

- `-n, --n_iterations INTEGER`: Number of iterations to train the crew (default: 5)
- `-f, --filename TEXT`: Path to a custom file for training (default: “trained_agents_data.pkl”)

Example:

```shell
crewai train -n 10 -f my_training_data.pkl
```

### [Replay the crew execution from a specific task.​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#4-replay)

4\. Replay

```shell
crewai replay [OPTIONS]
```

- `-t, --task_id TEXT`: Replay the crew from this task ID, including all subsequent tasks

Example:

```

### [Retrieve your latest crew.kickoff() task outputs.​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#5-log-tasks-outputs)

5\. Log-tasks-outputs

```shell
crewai log-tasks-outputs
```

### [Reset the crew memories (long, short, entity, latest_crew_kickoff_outputs).​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#6-reset-memories)

7\. Test

```shell
crewai test [OPTIONS]
```

- `-n, --n_iterations INTEGER`: Number of iterations to test the crew (default: 3)
- `-m, --model TEXT`: LLM Model to run the tests on the Crew (default: “gpt-4o-mini”)

Example:

```shell
crewai test -n 5 -m gpt-3.5-turbo
```

### [Run the crew.​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#8-run)

8\. Run

```shell
crewai run
```

Make sure to run these commands from the directory where your CrewAI project is set up. Some commands may require additional configuration or setup within your project structure.

### [​When running `crewai create crew` command, the CLI will first show you the top 5 most common LLM providers and ask you to select one.](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#9-api-keys)

9\. API Keys
Once you’ve selected an LLM provider, you will be prompted for API keys.

#### [Initial API key providers​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#initial-api-key-providers)

The CLI will initially prompt for API keys for the following services:

- OpenAI
- Groq
- Anthropic
- Google Gemini
- SambaNova

When you select a provider, the CLI will prompt you to enter your API key.

#### [Other Options​](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/#other-options)

If you select option 6, you will be able to select from a list of LiteLLM supported providers.

When you select a provider, the CLI will prompt you to enter the Key name and the API key.

See the following link for each provider’s key name:
