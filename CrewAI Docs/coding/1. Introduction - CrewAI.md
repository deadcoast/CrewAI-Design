# Introduction

Build AI agent teams that work together to tackle complex tasks

# What is CrewAI?

[​What is CrewAI?](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction#what-is-crewai)

**CrewAI is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents.**

CrewAI enables you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals, working together to accomplish complex tasks.

Think of it as assembling your dream team - each member (agent) brings unique skills and expertise, collaborating seamlessly to achieve your objectives.
