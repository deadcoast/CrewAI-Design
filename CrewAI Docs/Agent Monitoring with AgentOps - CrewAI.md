# Agent Monitoring with AgentOps

Understanding and logging your agent performance with AgentOps.

#

](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/#introduction)

Introduction

Observability is a key aspect of developing and deploying conversational AI agents. It allows developers to understand how their agents are performing, how their agents are interacting with users, and how their agents use external tools and APIs. AgentOps is a product independent of CrewAI that provides a comprehensive observability solution for agents.

AgentOps

[AgentOps](https://agentops.ai/?=crew) provides session replays, metrics, and monitoring for agents.

At a high level, AgentOps gives you the ability to monitor cost, token usage, latency, agent failures, session-wide statistics, and more. For more info, check out the [AgentOps Repo](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops).

Overview

AgentOps provides monitoring for agents in development and production. It provides a dashboard for tracking agent performance, session replays, and custom reporting.

Additionally, AgentOps provides session drilldowns for viewing Crew agent interactions, LLM calls, and tool usage in real-time. This feature is useful for debugging and understanding how agents interact with users as well as other agents.
