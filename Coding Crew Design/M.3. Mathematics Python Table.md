### How to Use This Table

- **Identify Your Agent or Workflow Step**: Locate the row(s) relevant to the agent you’re designing or the stage you’re optimizing (e.g., Analyzer Agent, Repository Management).
- **Pick the Right Library**: The “Technique / Library” column suggests which Python library or ecosystem tool is best suited.  
- **Leverage the Math / Algorithm**: The “Mathematics / Algorithm” column outlines the underpinning theory (e.g., integer linear programming, AST neural networks, constraint solving).
- **Achieve the Purpose**: The “Purpose / Use Case” column provides a real-world scenario for deploying the chosen technique—such as identifying code smells, optimizing test coverage, or enforcing architecture rules.

By combining these **Python-specific libraries** and **mathematical/algorithmic approaches** with the existing multi-agent framework, you create a **highly intelligent, data-driven** pipeline capable of handling vast, complex codebases while continually improving quality, performance, security, and maintainability.
